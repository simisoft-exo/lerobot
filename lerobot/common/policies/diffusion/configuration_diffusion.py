@dataclass
class DiffusionConfig:
    """Configuration class for DiffusionPolicy.

    Defaults are configured for training with PushT providing proprioceptive and single camera observations.

    The parameters you will most likely need to change are the ones which depend on the environment / sensors.
    Those are: `input_shapes` and `output_shapes`.

    Args:
        n_obs_steps: Number of environment steps worth of observations to pass to the policy (takes the
            current step and additional steps going back).
        horizon: Diffusion model action prediction size as detailed in `DiffusionPolicy.select_action`.
        n_action_steps: The number of action steps to run in the environment for one invocation of the policy.
            See `DiffusionPolicy.select_action` for more details.
        input_shapes: A dictionary defining the shapes of the input data for the policy.
            The key represents the input data name, and the value is a list indicating the dimensions
            of the corresponding data. For example, "observation.image" refers to an input from
            a camera with dimensions [3, 96, 96], indicating it has three color channels and 96x96 resolution.
            Importantly, shapes doesnt include batch dimension or temporal dimension.
        output_shapes: A dictionary defining the shapes of the output data for the policy.
            The key represents the output data name, and the value is a list indicating the dimensions
            of the corresponding data. For example, "action" refers to an output shape of [14], indicating
            14-dimensional actions. Importantly, shapes doesnt include batch dimension or temporal dimension.
        input_normalization_modes: A dictionary with key representing the modality (e.g. "observation.state"),
            and the value specifies the normalization mode to apply. The two available modes are "mean_std"
            which subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation and "min_max" which rescale in a
            [-1, 1] range.
        output_normalization_modes: Similar dictionary as `normalize_input_modes`, but to unnormalize to the
            original scale. Note that this is also used for normalizing the training targets.
        vision_backbone: Name of the torchvision resnet backbone to use for encoding images.
        crop_shape: (H, W) shape to crop images to as a preprocessing step for the vision backbone. Must fit
            within the image size. If None, no cropping is done.
        crop_is_random: Whether the crop should be random at training time (it's always a center crop in eval
            mode).
        pretrained_backbone_weights: Pretrained weights from torchvision to initalize the backbone.
            `None` means no pretrained weights.
        use_group_norm: Whether to replace batch normalization with group normalization in the backbone.
            The group sizes are set to be about 16 (to be precise, feature_dim // 16).
        spatial_softmax_num_keypoints: Number of keypoints for SpatialSoftmax.
        down_dims: Feature dimension for each stage of temporal downsampling in the diffusion modeling Unet.
            You may provide a variable number of dimensions, therefore also controlling the degree of
            downsampling.
        kernel_size: The convolutional kernel size of the diffusion modeling Unet.
        n_groups: Number of groups used in the group norm of the Unet's convolutional blocks.
        diffusion_step_embed_dim: The Unet is conditioned on the diffusion timestep via a small non-linear
            network. This is the output dimension of that network, i.e., the embedding dimension.
        use_film_scale_modulation: FiLM (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871) is used for the Unet conditioning.
            Bias modulation is used be default, while this parameter indicates whether to also use scale
            modulation.
        noise_scheduler_type: Name of the noise scheduler to use. Supported options: ["DDPM", "DDIM"].
        num_train_timesteps: Number of diffusion steps for the forward diffusion schedule.
        beta_schedule: Name of the diffusion beta schedule as per DDPMScheduler from Hugging Face diffusers.
        beta_start: Beta value for the first forward-diffusion step.
        beta_end: Beta value for the last forward-diffusion step.
        prediction_type: The type of prediction that the diffusion modeling Unet makes. Choose from "epsilon"
            or "sample". These have equivalent outcomes from a latent variable modeling perspective, but
            "epsilon" has been shown to work better in many deep neural network settings.
        clip_sample: Whether to clip the sample to [-`clip_sample_range`, +`clip_sample_range`] for each
            denoising step at inference time. WARNING: you will need to make sure your action-space is
            normalized to fit within this range.
        clip_sample_range: The magnitude of the clipping range as described above.
        num_inference_steps: Number of reverse diffusion steps to use at inference time (steps are evenly
            spaced). If not provided, this defaults to be the same as `num_train_timesteps`.
        do_mask_loss_for_padding: Whether to mask the loss when there are copy-padded actions. See
            `LeRobotDataset` and `load_previous_and_future_frames` for mor information. Note, this defaults
            to False as the original Diffusion Policy implementation does the same.
